	</div>
		<p style="font-size:120%;"><b>G Day</b> is closely approaching and the whole bulldog community is excited. Everyone is excited to see all the freshman play and test their skills. The player to look out for is freshman quarterback, Jake Fromm. The university is not expecting such a large crowd as last year but still larger than the average spring game. The weather is supposed to be nice and sunny so bring your sun screen. You will also want to drink a lot of water so you won't be dehydrated. The university is not expecting such a large crowd as last year but still larger than the average spring game. It should be a good game none the less.

	<p style="font-size:120%;"> After the spring game there will be a party hosted by the lovely residents of the <i>JP2</i> household. There will be live music in the backyard as well as a blow up waterslide. A keg will be brought in for drinks to people who are of age. All other drinks will be BYOB. Tacos will be served for people who get hungry. This party will start right after the game and end whenever everyone leaves. We will also be selling T-shirts if you would like to remember your time at the party.</p>
	<p style="font-size:120%;"> With all this fun you need to remember to stay safe! Please eat food if you are going to drink alcohol. Pace yourself when you are drinking. Do not drink alcohol if you are under aged! Everyone should drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Be a defensive driver when you are on the road with so many other people trying to leave campus. Finally look both ways while crossing the street.</p>
